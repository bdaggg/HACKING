there is a vulnerability on the machine called 'shellshock'. when we search for it in metasploit, many exploits come up. it is possible to infiltrate the machine using one of these exploits, when we scan with nikto, we find the target sh file (/cgi-bin/test.sh). when we infiltrate the machine, we need to upgrade. you can review the c code I used for the upgrade above.
